When we create an instance of Internet Explorer, we  get
an IWebBrowser. (It is a multi interface, possibly a
WebBrowser coclass which contains IWebBrowser and IWebBrowser2.)
It is the IWebBrowser that has the Document method.
This returns a generic IDispatch. However, by some snooping
on the Web and perhaps by looking at the UUIDs of the actual object
and comparing them to those in the Type Library, we can determine
that this is an IHTMLDocument2 object from the MSHTML library.
This is the one that has the links property
which is an IHTMLElementCollection.

That has an item and a length method, not an Item and a Count.
So we have to recognize this in our getListClassName function.
We should do this on the basis of the names of the methods
or alternatively the name of the class since IHTMLElementCollection
is an obvious collection. We also need to introduce another 
COMList type which knows what the methods are for Item and Count.



Once we have a link, it is an IHTMLElement.
It has, for example, a method named innerHTML which gives
the contents. 


links = ie$Document()$links()
n = links[["length"]]
targets = sapply(1:n, function(i) links$item(i)[["href"]])

ie$Document()
