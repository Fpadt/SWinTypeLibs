<dl>

  <dt>
  <li> Does getRefTypeName() really need the reference? Can we get it from the ref
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> Why does getElements not take the names of the entries and a library
    and work in a vectorized manner.
  <dd>


  <dt>
  <li> See if we can get LoadTypeLib("Excel.Application") to work.
  <dd> Ideally, don't create a new instance of the application.

  <dt>
  <li> Add support for enumerations in generated code.
  <dd> Done.

  <dt>
  <li> Get the event material finished.
  <dd>  Done, I think.
    <ul>
    <li> Tune the function to get event interfaces from the type library.
    </ul>
  
 

 <dt>
 <li>  Make getElements() work for alias.
 <dd>

 <dt>
 <li> Arrange the .COM call in the methods with missing arguments handled correctly.
 <dd>  Modify generateMethod()

 <dt>
 <li> Can we determine the default value of a parameter.
 <dd> See R_describeParameter.

 <dt>
 <li> Figure out why table() is seg-faulting after some operations.
 <dd>
   Need some examples.
   <br>
    I was seeing some segfaults also after accessing lib[ ]


 <dt> ITypeComp for access to globals, etc.?
 <dd> 

 <dt> Hidden fields.
 <dd> Hidden flag for functions/properties.

 <dt> Get the TYPEFLAGS for an ITypeInfo, etc.
 <dd>


 <dt> Duplicate entries.
 <dd> In the getFuncs().
    They are legitimate, I think, but it would be good to have
     classes for them, e.g. PropertyGet, PropertyPut.

 <dt> Arrays in RDCOMClient.
 <dd>

 <dt>
 <li> Optionally, put a name on a getTypeInfo(com.instance)
 <dd> Read the type library, get the name, etc.

 <dt>
 <li> create a COMError class and raise that 
      so that people can handle it in a tryCatch().
 <dd> Move (and share) this with  DCOMClient.

 <dt>
 <li> Methods for the "show" generic for different classes.
 <dd> Pretty printing.


 <dt>
 <li> getTypeInfo for IConnectionPoint objects.
 <dd>

 <dt>
 <li> Use the DISPID/memid in the ElementDescriptionType to avoid 
      having to do the lookup of the DISPID first.

 <dd> i.e. compile this into C code.
      Also, the .COM accepts the dispatch argument, so can use it directly
      when generating bindings.


 <dt>
 <li> handle records, modules, aliases for types.
 <dd>  Get some examples.     

 <dt>
 <li> types of the variants in the arguments.
 <dd> VARIANT_BOOL, VARIANT, etc.     
      
 <dt>
 <li> sort out the type objects when pointers.
 <dd>

 <dt>
 <li> UnloadTypeLib
 <dd>  Does it automatically happen when we remove the handle to it
   by referencing counting? Or do we explicitly have to release it?
   Do we have to unregister it?

       
</dl>

<h3>Done</h3>
<dl>

 <dt>
 <li> QueryPathOfRegTypeLib
 <dd> 
      Need guid, version, language.
      <br>


 <dt> Accessing existing object rather than creating a new one.
 <dd>  getCOMInstance().   GetActiveObject?


  <dt>
  <li> Make the COMTypedList work with, for example,  _Workbook rather than Workbooks
  <dd> We can resolve the Workbook element in the library and then if this is 
     not a dispatch object, then resolve its coclass and see if there is 
      _&lt;name&gt; element there and use that.
      Without class fields, we have to store the name of the type 
      in the COMList class. Perhaps we need to define
      a new one such as 
        setClass("Workbooks", contains = "COMTypedNamedList",
                   prototype = list(name = "_Workbook"))

<br>
      So we need to add this to the output.
      We need to return an object that will print appropriately.


 <dt> TypeLibrary attributes?  GetLibAttr?
 <dd>  getTypeLibInfo().

 <dt>
 <li> Lookup an element in the type library indexed by UUID
 <dd> By guid or uuid ?  
    <br>
   getTypeByUUID(id, lib)
   Can add this to the [[. <font color="red">Done.</font>
<br>
   getTypeLibUUIDs(lib)
    

 <dt>
 <li>  Get type library from an object.
 <dd>  Done.     


 <dt>
 <li>  reftype in ParameterDescription
 <dd>  getFuncs(lib[["IAppEvents"]])$SheetChange@parameters[[2]]@type

  Note that for the AppEvents class, we get a different reftype value
   50377248 (rather than 45600)
<br>
    getRefTypeInfo()

 <dt>
 <li> Change the type of the function if it is a property - get or set.
 <dd> Make these different derived classes.
    <br/>
    Already have the classes defined. Just create instances of these.
  PropertyGetDescription, PropertySetDescription, PropertySetRefDescription,
   FunctionInvokeDescription..


 <dt> Classes for the different ITypeInfo derivatives.
 <dd> The type information gives this, but not by the class of the object.
      e.g. for enum or coclass of lib[["Application"]] it should be
           EnumTypeLibEntry or CoclassTypeLibEntry.
    <br> Done as   ITypeInfoEnum, ITypeInfoDispatch, ...
 <dt>
 <li> Is a ITypeLibEntry the same as a ITypeInfo?
 <dd> Yes, and now removed.

  <dt> Invoke type for methods needs a name for the integer constant.
  <dd> Done

 <dt>
 <li> put the type attribute's GUID into an S slot.
 <dd> Done.
<pre>
names(typelib)
i = typelib[["Workbook"]] 
.Call("R_GetGuid", i)
</pre>

 <dt>
 <li> names for the coclass elements.
 <dd>
      Got memid for each of the other types.
      How can we find the name from an ITypeInfo?

      Can use the GUID to do a post-hoc lookup in the context
      of some other table.
